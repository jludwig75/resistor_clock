# Resistor Clock
This project uses an ESP32 TTGO T-Display to display a clock that uses resistor
colors. The intention of this project is to help me memorize the resistor colors
so I can read them as well as numbers. I plan to make this also work as a
tratitional clock. I can use one of the buttons to toggle the display mode. I
would also like to add an RTC. With an RTC, this would make a great travel
clock. The TTGO T-Display also already has a battery port and charger.

See the project for an idea of the road map:
