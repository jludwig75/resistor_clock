# Resistor Clock
This project uses an ESP32 TTGO T-Display to display a clock that uses resistor colors.
The intention of this project is to help me memorize the resistor colors as well as
numbers so I can quickly read resister values. This can also be used as a clock. I plan
to add a standard clock display. I would also like to add an RTC. With and RTC, this
would make a great travel clock. The TTGO T-Display already has a battery port and
charger.
